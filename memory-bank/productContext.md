# Product Context: Moneyflow

## Why this project exists
Managing personal and shared expenses often involves manual data entry from physical receipts, which is tedious and error-prone. Moneyflow solves this by automating the extraction of data and providing a collaborative, **project-centric** platform for tracking shared costs.

## Problems it Solves
- **Context Switching**: Organizes expenses into discrete "Projects" (e.g., Vacation vs. Home), preventing data pollution.
- **Optimized Debt Settlement**: Automatically calculates an efficient settlement plan, minimizing the number of payments needed.
- **Manual Data Entry**: Automates receipt reading using Vision AI.
- **Cryptic Receipt Names**: Maps confusing abbreviations on receipts to human-readable "friendly names."
- **Privacy & Ownership**: Designed for self-hosting with granular participation-based visibility.

## How it Works
1. **Login**: Users access their account via a secure portal.
2. **Project Participation**: Users view a list of projects they are currently part of.
3. **Input**: Inside a project, users upload receipt images or create purchases manually.
4. **Processing**: The system uses Vision AI to extract structured item data.
5. **Refining**: Users verify data and assign contributors from the project's active participant list.
6. **Money Flow**: The system calculates the most efficient way for the group to settle up.
7. **Personalized Analytics**: Users view spending habits via dashboards, filtered to include only data from their current projects.

## User Experience Goals
- **Project Isolation**: Leaving a project immediately removes its clutter from the user's view and statistics.
- **Collaborative Control**: Every member of a project has equal rights to manage its details and membership.
- **Historical Integrity**: Leaving a project does not delete your historical contributions; you remain listed on past purchases to keep group stats accurate.
- **Clarity in Focus**: Minimalist design that prioritizes legibility and reduces cognitive load.
- **Responsiveness**: Seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
